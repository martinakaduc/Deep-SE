These are the datasets and supplementary resources for our submission entitled: A deep learning model for estimating story points

For verifiability, we provided our story points datasets (the issues with story points from 16 projects collected from 9 open source repositories), the pre-train data (the title and the description of the issues without story points collected from 9 open source repositories) that has been used for pre-training LSTM, the pre-trained LSTM models, and our Deep-SE source code including the script to run the experiments.

We also provide the replication of the Purru et al.'s method and their dataset that we used in our study.
