KANOO-4997,Story,[ARM Merchant] - Products - Set Point Reward in product level,"*Acceptance Criteria*

* When creating/product, there is a new setting called Point Earned. This setting overrides the global setting in ARM Master. 
* Point Earned field has Yes/No option
** Selecting No disables No of Points field. This is selected by default. If I enter a number in No of Points then select No, that number is reset to 0. *Products that are set to No will give user points normally if ARM Master sets the points*
** Selecting Yes enables No of Points field to enter the number of point that user can receive if buying that products
*** The maximum of number I can enter is 9999. A number has 4 digits. Only integers
*** This is the number of point I can receive when buying 1 unit product. For instance, product A sets 10 points so that If I buy 2 product A, I get 20 points.
*** *This setting overrides the global setting in ARM Master.* 
**** For instance, ARM Master sets to receive 10 points for buying any products (1 unit). In ARM Merchant, I set buying product A gets 5 points only. Therefore, when I buy 3 products A, I will get 15 points
* If I do not enter No of Points then save that product, it displays browser alert {color:#00b8d9}_“Please input point earned\!“_{color}
* Point Earned amount will be paid by Point Balance of that merchant. If Point Balance or merchant is not enough to pay for user, do not push notification
* Notification
** Currently, For example, ARM Master sets 3 points for buying any products. If I buy 2 products (Same or Different), I will get 2 notifications, +3 and +3
** From now, If I buy 1 product A (not set Point Earned) and 2 product B (set Point Earned 5 Points), I will gets 3 notifications, +3 , +5, +5
** Clicking on the notifications goes to Point screen under Wallet as current

The ""Long Island"" is added to the Islands list when customers verify level 2.

However, when compared with the list of Islands in the ticket, I see that the Island named “*Acklins and Crooked Island*” is changed to “*Acklins*” but the Island named “*New Providence and Paradise Island*” is still being kept.

Should we change it like the ticket provided?

Flow of refactoring: separate old flow to

# Transaction: PENDING (withdraw user success), SUCCESS (settle transaction to Merchant Success)

* Develop a function to run the settlement within a date range and this process will be triggered manually from Visipay.
* The settlement progress of each merchant will be executed with the information.
** The settlement process must be done for each day within the settlement date range and store the correct value of the merchant balance into the report for each date. 
*** Revenue of a day = total credit - total debit - fee - fee VAT (all transactions of that day)
**** balance of day n = balance of day n-1 + revenue of day n
** This process must be handled in the background and display a new balance on Visipay - Merchant Balance Report.
*** Old Balance - this is the balance saved before the settlement.
*** New Balance - new balance is saved after the settlement.
** Visipay Admin will export the balance report with new balance value and the new balance value will be the same as the old balance by default if there is no settlement for that date.
** The settlement process can be executed again whenever the Kanoo admin decides to do that, so the system does not need to validate this.

KANOO-4642,Story,[BE] KanooPOS - Pay - Allow using Coupons ,"As a staff or manager paying by KanooPOS, I should have the ability to scan QR codes of coupon.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* When using Pay on KanooPOS, clicking on Scan button can scan QR code or enter character code of a coupon.
* If that code is not a valid code by any reasons, display the message “This is an invalid code”
* If that code is valid, it applies that coupon immediately. There is a new section called Coupon positioned above . It displays the value of selected coupon. Depending on the coupon types, after scanning/ typing QR code, the discount is applied as below
** If coupon type is %OFF, display the exact number calculated. For example, Payment Amount is $10.00 (no discount) and I use 50% OFF coupon so that I see “Coupon >    -$5.00”.
** If coupon type is Voucher, display the exact number. For example, Payment Amount is $10.00 (no discount) and I use $5.00 coupon (voucher) so that I see “Coupon >    -$5.00”.
** If coupon type is Buy X Get Y,  display the text “Gift products“
* We have 3 PAY workflows in KanooPOS. Below is how each type of coupon is applied in each Pay workflow
** Pay:
*** Voucher: Apply as normal
*** %OFF: 
**** If that coupon is applied to ALL products, it is scanned as normal and discount as normal
**** If that coupon is applied to a specific product, it is scanned as normal and discount as normal. This is based on the awareness of the staff who is using that POS.
*** Buy X Get Y: Scanning this applies the coupon as normal. This is based on the awareness of the staff who is using that POS.
** Pay in Order Creation workflow: including Pay with QR and Pay Later
*** Voucher: Apply as normal
*** %OFF:
**** If that coupon is applied to ALL products, it is scanned as normal and discount as normal
**** If that coupon is applied to a specific product, scanning it discounts only that specific product
*** Buy X Get Y: Scanning this applies the coupon as normal but it will not effect to the product stocks. We have will have a story to remake it.
* After I applied the coupon, clicking on > button goes to details page where I can see the information of applied coupon
** If coupon type is %OFF, display the image, name, %OFF amount (ex, 10% or 50%). 
** If coupon type is Voucher, display the image, name, Voucher amount (ex, $100.00, $7.00)
** If coupon type is Buy X Get Y, display the image and name 
* After I scanned a coupon (or enter character code), If I want to change to another coupon, I can scan another coupon. The new one replaces the old one.
* I can select only one Coupon to Pay. This can be one of 3 types as above
* I can use both gift cards and coupon at the same time.
* Ensure the priority of use is the same with Checkout flow in Kanoo apps: Coupon, Gift Card, User Card
* Transaction: after paying with coupons successfully, I see transaction written in Visipay, KanooPOS, ARM
** Transaction type: Coupon Redemption
** Amount: this is the amount reduced. In case of Buy X Get Y, amount is $0.00
* Transaction in KanooPOS: we have had a transaction type called “Coupon“. It is changed to “Coupon Redemption“

KANOO-4609,Story,[BE] - Multiple Merchant Money Flow,"Currently, when a user receives a Gift Cash Card that can be used at multiple merchants from GDS, the issuer’s Cash Card balance isn't deducted. The user can use it at the issued merchant or another accepted merchant. If he uses it at the issued merchant, the payment flow doesn't change. If he uses it at another accepted merchant, that merchant has to pay the fee related to the function and paid amount. This doesn't make sense so that we need to define the flow.

The solution is after a user uses a Gift cash Card at an accepted merchant ( except the issued merchant) successfully. Kanoo Reserve Account will fund the paid amount for the accepted merchant immediately. The accepted merchant only pays the fee related to the function. Below is the money flow when a user uses a Gift Cash Card from GDS at multiple linked merchants.

*Step 1:* a GDS manager creates, marks issuer merchant then sends Gift Cash Card to users successfully. The issuer merchant pays nothing for Kanoo

*Step 2:* The user uses the Gift Cash Card at a linked merchant and issuer successfully.

The linked merchant pays the fee *“Kanoo Cash Card - Processing Fee”* for Kanoo based on the paid amount and function. *Save transaction as the current flow on ARM, Visipay.*

So that when I view Users List, the column “Linked Merchant” displays the issuer name. Kanoo has made an enhancement that a GC can be redeemed at multiple merchants so the column is displaying incorrectly. We need to show all merchants from the latest issuance

*Step 1:* I access the feature “Users” then view the final column

*Step 2:* I expect to see the column “Linked Merchants” displays merchants based on these case:

# If that GC can be redeemed at the selected merchants, I would see “View more”, click to open a pop-up named “Accept at” then a list of merchants.
# If that GC can be redeemed at all merchants, the value is “All Merchants”
# If that GC can not be redeemed at the selected merchant, I would see “View more”, click to open a pop-up named “Accept at all except” then a list of merchants.

1.Can user search by pressing Enter on keyboard? I check this on Transactions page and it does not work currently, so I need the confirm on this page.

2.Should the redundant spaces be trimmed before searching? Ex: Customer Name is John Smith, order ID is 123abc can we search by following keywords:

* “ john“
* “john “  
* “john   smith”
* “123  “
* “  abc”

3.What is the default value of Status / Payment Method?

4.If the order is paid tottally by a gift card or a coupon, so what is the Payment Method which we’ll save on this page (Orders)?

1.It is the same with Transaction page. We have to click on Search button

2.It’s a great idea but I think it will take much time to handle. Currently, we will not need it

3.I just add ALL to the list. ALL is the default

4.I see we still get Payment Method as normal regardless you paid the order totally by a gift card or a coupon. It always has a specific Payment method.

KANOO-4434,Story,iOS - KanooPOS - Manager Sends GC Refund Request,"Currently, a POS Manager can only refund Kanoo users based on the paid cash card or SD card. They can not get their money back if they paid the orders with GC only. From now, the POS Manager can create a GC refund request for a GC redemption transaction. Then if the Merchant admin approves the request, a new GC will be sent to the consumers. This feature supports for GDS giftcard.

*Step 1:* In feature “Transaction”, I filter the list with type “Refund“. I click on a “Gift Card Redemption”, I would see a button named “Refund Transaction” or refund information if that transaction is refunded

* If that transaction is from the gift card not issued from GDS then disable the button

*Step 2:* I click the button then I see a new screen named “Request Refund”, where I can enter a reason and take pictures

# *June 10, 2021:* Reason: limit 500 characters and only accept \[a-z]\[A-Z]\[0-9], dot, comma, colon,  and whitespace. This is the required field
# I can take a maximum of 3 images. I can also remove the images and click to see the image with full size. This is optional.
# If I click the button to take the fourth image, I receive the message “You can only take a maximum of 3 images.“

*Step 3:* Then I click the button “Send request”, the system will check:

# *June 14, 2021,* If the Reason field is blank or only contain whitespaces-, pop up notify the customer with the content “Please enter your reason.”.- the button is still disabled
# If send successfully, pop up with content “Your request was sent successfully.” I click Close to turn off the pop-up to return to the gift card redemption transaction list
# If send unsuccessfully, pop up with content “Your request was sent unsuccessfully. Please try again.”  I click Close to turn off the pop-up and stay at the current screen with entered values.
# The transactions will have the status “Refund Pending”

*Step 4: June 15, 2021* The list transaction “Gift Card Redemption” is updated. It is sorted by the latest redeem date then the statuses “Refund Rejected”, “Refund Pending”, and “Refunded”

# If I click on a transaction with the status “Refund Rejected”, I can create a request again from step 1
# If I click on a transaction with the status “Refunded”, I can view the refund information like the current purchase refund
# If I click on a transaction with the status “Pending”, I can view the refund information like transaction-id 

*Example for a refund flow:* 

# The manager sends a request for the transaction “Gift Card Redemption”, this transaction shows $9.76 ( the amount user has redeemed). The transaction details show $9.76 and $0.01 ( fee merchant pays redeem fee)
# After the request is approved, the manager sees 2 transaction
##  “Gift Card Redemption”
## “Gift Card Refund“ display $9.99 (refunded amount for user + refund fee of merchant ). The transaction details show $9.00 and $0.99 ( fee merchant pays refund fee)
# *June 14, 2021*, I would like to see new information named “Refund Gift Card“that displays approved refund amount 

*AC update:*

When going to detail of “gift Card Refund“ transaction, I should see

* <merchant that reunded the gift card>/<4 digits of card that merchant used to refund>
* Add label “Refund Transaction ID“

KANOO-4432,Story,[iOS] - Product Details - View product media,"As a user viewing product details page through mobile apps, I should have the ability to view  medias (including videos and images) of a product. This provides users different angles of a product, also helps them in buying products effectively. 

*Acceptance Criteria:*

When going to detail page of a product, I see the first image

* If it has only one image, do not display the Total Media Tag
* If it has many medias, 
** There is a Total Media Tag positioned in the bottom-right corner of the current image
*** Format: <the current position>/<the total number of media>. For instance, I have totally 15 images and staying at the first images, it should be 1/15
** I can swipe left to see the next medias or swipe right to see the previous ones. Ensure when users swipe, <the current position> is also changed
*** If I’m staying at 15/15, swiping left is back to 1/15
*** If I’m staying at 1/15, swiping right is back to 15/15
** Video
*** Videos are not played by default. Every time I swipe, if the next/previous media is a video, it displays the video thumbnail with a PLAY button positioned in the center. Clicking on that PLAY button or that video opens the Media Detail View and that video is automatically played.
*** Youtube video ❓ 
** Image
*** Clicking on one image opens the Media Detail View to view that image

+_Media Detail View_+ 

* I can see the media carousel positioned at the bottom. When I select a media in the carousel, it is displayed above the carousel
** I can swipe left to see the next medias or swipe right to see the previous ones
** When a media is selected, it is highlighted. 
** In the carousel, how to know that is a video? It has a play button with thumbnail
* Video
** Videos are played by default. Every time I swipe, if the next/previous media is a video, if the next/previous media is a video, it plays the video automatically. *Note that if I play video from Normal view, it also always opens the Media Detail View and that video is automatically played.*
** There is a player bar including things below.
*** Pause, Play buttons. 
*** Progress Bar to move to any moment in the video
*** Mute/Unmute buttons. Don’t need to increase/decrease volume
** If a video is being played or paused then I select another media then back to that video, the video is replayed automatically
** Youtube video ❓ 
* Magnifier
** I can pinch 2 fingers together in the image to zoom in and vice versa. 
** I can double tap on image to zoom in
* Close button
** Clicking on this is back to the normal view. 
** After clicking on Close button, I should stay at the last media that I stayed in Media View. For example, in Media Detail View, I stay at the 4th image, after clicking on Close button, I should stay at the 4th image in Normal View.

I think this AC seems to be wrong.

*“Every time I swipe, if the next/previous media is a video, it is played by default. (I have to click on Play button to play the video initially).“*

1.On Media Detail view, when playing a video, can users mute/unmute it?

2.

For the Youtube video imported by merchant in ARM:

* If the link is valid: on Media Detail view, when clicking Play button, the video will still play in the app or Youtube web / app will auto open and play that video?
* If the link is invalid (not a Youtube link or the link does not exist): will we still show or hide it from Normal View and Media Detail view?;[~accountid:5caacdb1055f3f7a1824b0dc] I have answered your question as below

Yes. It should be *“Every time I swipe, if the next/previous media is a video, it is NOT played by default. (I have to click on Play button to play the video initially).“*

1.Yes.I can mute and unmute video, no volume decrease/increase. [~accountid:6051e03fe394c30069b4748b] [~accountid:5fabcec18c4efd006f63ee20] Could you please take care this? Thanks

* If it has only one image, do not display the Total Media Tag
* If it has many medias, 
** There is a Total Media Tag positioned in the bottom-right corner of the current image
*** Format: <the current position>/<the total number of media>. For instance, I have totally 15 images and staying at the first images, it should be 1/15
** I can swipe left to see the next medias or swipe right to see the previous ones. Ensure when users swipe, <the current position> is also changed
*** If I’m staying at 15/15, swiping left is back to 1/15
*** If I’m staying at 1/15, swiping right is back to 15/15
** Video
*** Videos are not played by default. Every time I swipe, if the next/previous media is a video, it displays the video thumbnail with a PLAY button positioned in the center. Clicking on that PLAY button or that video opens the Media Detail View and that video is automatically played.
*** Youtube video ❓ 
** Image
*** Clicking on one image opens the Media Detail View to view that image

* Order & Customer Information
** Customer Name, Phone, Email, Order ID, Order Date: retrieve exactly information as KanooPOS displayed 
** Order Status: view more information here [https://kardsys.atlassian.net/browse/KANOO-4426|https://kardsys.atlassian.net/browse/KANOO-4426|smart-link] 
* Delivery Information
** Delivery Method
** If Delivery Method is Delivery (Scan QR Code) orDelivery (Leave At Door), the next 3 fields should be Delivery Address, Delivery Date, Delivery Time
** If Delivery Method is Pickup or Pay Now, the next 3 fields should be Pickup Address, Pickup Date, Pickup Time
** Ensure time and date are converted by client time
* Order Items: Display the following things
** Items: List products in that order.

*** Product options
*** Price of one quantity. In case of discount, display prices before and after discounts
** Quantity
** Price: the total price of that product based on quantity
** Line items: Sub Total, TAX (VAT), Gift Card, Coupon, Point Redemption, Total
*** Display -$0.00 if consumer did not use discounts type
* Click x button or outside to close the modal

+_Update Order Status_+

* While viewing order details, Order Status is a drop-menu that I update as workflow in KanooPOS
* Based on the order delivery method, the list of status will be different
** If the delivery method of that order is Pickup, it includes New, Preparing, Ready, Shipping, Completed
*** If the current status is New, expanding the drop-down menu can see Preparing
*** If the current status is Preparing, expanding the drop-down menu can see Ready
*** If the current status is Ready, expanding the drop-down menu can see Completed
*** If the current status is Completed, the drop-down can not be expanded
** If Delivery Method selection is Delivery, this includes New, Preparing, Ready, Shipping, Completed. 
*** The status-changing works step-by-step as Pickup
** Every time the status is changed, send emails to user/guest as when using KanooPOS
* When the order status is Shipping (for Delivery) or Ready (for Pickup), selecting Completed displays a modal includes 2 options: Enter QR code, Confirm without QR code. If delivery method is Delivery, modal title is “Confirm Delivery”.  If delivery method is Pickup, modal title is “Confirm Pickup“
** Enter QR code: selecting this display a field to enter QR code, in this case it is a character code
*** Only accept the character code of that order. All letters entered are automatically uppercase.
*** If entered code is empty, disable Confirm button.
*** Trim all spaces when clicking on Confirm button
*** If I enter an invalid QR code, clicking on Confirm button displays red validation message {color:#00b8d9}_“This code is invalid“_{color}
*** If I enter a valid QR code, clicking on Confirm button completes the order. After that, it navigates back to order details modal, I can see the status is updated to Completed
** Confirm without QR code: selecting this displays an upload image button and Note field. 
*** Upload Image button: This is optional. The purpose is to upload the image of customer to confirm that he/she got the good. 
**** The maximum of file size is 10MB. JPEG, PNG, JPG, WEBP, BMP, GIF and TIFF are allowable file types
**** After uploading image, it validates
***** Image File Size should not be larger than 5MB. Display message {color:#00b8d9}“{color}{color:#00b8d9}_The image is exceeding the allowable file size of 5MB. Please try again\!”_{color}
***** If uploading an images whose file type is not supported. Display message {color:#00b8d9}_“Image only allow file types of JPEG, PNG, JPG, WEBP, BMP, GIF and TIFF. Please try again\!“_{color}
**** After passing the validations, there is a tool to crop it, ensure the image is cropped by square ratio.
**** Only upload one image at the same time. Uploading another will replace the old one.
**** There is a X button to delete the uploaded one
*** Note: This is optional. The purpose is to take some notes.
**** Set max-length for 1000 characters
*** Clicking on Confirm button displays completes the order. After that, it navigates back to order details modal, I can see the status is updated to Completed. 
**** If I have uploaded an image, it displays a field called “Delivery-confirmed photo“. This has a View button that clicking on it opens the image in a new browser tab
**** If I have taken a note, it displays a field called “Note“. This displays exactly the content that I have submitted
* Ensure Order Confirmation emails are sent to users as when using KanooPOS. Also, push notifications to users as normal.

+_Check KanooPOS interaction_+

* If both ARM merchant and staff/manager change status of an order at the same time, we have notifications of changes
* For any status changes except for Completed, display a message to the last one detecting the change
** For example, both ARM and one staff (using POS) are gonna changing status of order A that has New status. First, the staff changes status from New to Preparing successfully. Next ARM Merchant starts changing status from New to Preparing but when he selects Preparing, it displays message in a modal {color:#00b8d9}_“This order has been processed by another staff“_{color}. Clicking on OK button updates the status into Preparing in Order Details modal. 
** The same workflow if ARM merchant changes status first
** The same workflow when changing next status
* In case of Completed status, display a message to the last one detecting the change
** For example, both ARM and one staff (using POS) are gonna changing status of order A into Completed. First, the staff changes status from Shipping (or Ready) to Completed successfully. Next ARM Merchant starts changing status from Shipping (or Ready) to Completed. After he clicks on Confirm buttons (regardless which options he chose to confirm order), it displays message in a modal {color:#00b8d9}_“This order is already completed“_{color}. Clicking on OK button updates the status into Preparing in Order Details modal.

1.As you know, Pickup orders do not have Shipping status, the staffs can change order status from Ready to Complete right away, will it have 2 options:  Enter QR code and Confirm Without QR code, is it correct? Moreover, currently the Shipping orders can be only completed by delivery staffs (Kanoo Order Delivery app), I think ARM staffs can only update to Shipping status, the rest will handled on Order Delivery app. What do you think?

2.Should the redundant spaces trimmed when we click Confirm? Ex: QR code is 123abcde, enter “   123abcd“, when clicking Confirm it’ll changed to “123abcd“ and the order can be completed normally.

*“Only accept the character code of that order. Make all letters uppercase”*. Do you mean that QR code field only accepts alphabet and numeric characters, not space or any special characters?

!image-20210607-071020.png|width=1341,height=533!

3.Which types of image file will we support ARM staffs to upload? Can the staffs upload multiple files at the same time or one by one? How many maximumly files can the staffs upload?

4. *”Ensure the image is always in square frame”* On this AC, do you mean that when we upload the file there will have a crop tool with the square frame? Can the staffs adjust that frame to another shape? Or is it the fixed frame?

5. Could you please provide more UI: 

* How we display the uploaded images on this modal.
* How we delete the images.

!image-20210607-071721.png|width=1339,height=609!

6. *“This has a View link that clicking on it can see the uploaded image“* Please provide more details AC for this one.

9.The title of this modal seems incorrect.

1.As we discussed, both Delivery and Pickup have the modal to confirm the order before status is changed to ORDER

2.Agree. Trimming spaces is better. All letters entered are automatically uppercase.

3.JPEG, PNG, JPG, WEBP, BMP, GIF and TIFF are allowable file types

4.Yes. After uploading image, there is a tool to crop it, ensure the image is cropped by square ratio. It’s something like the tool to crop the image when creating a product

!image-20210608-154227.png|width=598,height=645!

5.Yes I have updated it

6.This has a View button that clicking on it opens the image in a new browser tab

7.Yes. Ensure Order Confirmation emails are sent to users as when using KanooPOS. Also, push notifications to users as normal

8.Yes. It should be “Confirm without QR Code“. I’ll update it 

9.Yes.I It should be “Confirm without QR Code“.  I’ll update it

What is the differences of the larger view and the largest view that you mentioned in description?

2.Can user scroll the vertical bar by scroll-wheel of the mouse?

3.Are up-arrow and down-arrow always displayed on the vertical bar? And the same question for left-arrow and right-arrow (at Media Detail view).

4.Will the biggest image (marked by red in the below picture) be changed if user selects another image from the list at left? 

!image-20210607-103019.png|width=1263,height=525!

5.Will we handle to display some social networks on this page (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest)? If not, please help to remove on UI design to avoid the confusion.

6.*”There is X button to close the window. If I’m viewing the 4th image in Media Detail, I close the view, I expect that I’m still viewing the 4th image in normal view”*

What if on the vertical list (normal view), I’m selecting the 3rd image or video, then I double-click on that one to view with the largest version, will it display the 3rd image or video of list as the same?

7.By default, the video is muted or unmuted when being started playing? If the video length is 30 seconds, when video is playing:

* I click Pause at 00:14, then click Close, then from the normal view (Product Detail page) I double-click on that video from the list, then I click Play on Media Detail view, will the video resume from 00:14 or it’s restarted?
*  Same question if I click Close without clicking Pause video.

[8.|http://8.By]For the Youtube video imported by merchant in ARM:

* If the link is valid: on Media Detail view, when clicking Play button, the video will still play at KZ site or Youtube web / app will auto open and play that video?
* If the link is invalid (not a Youtube link or the link does not exist): will we still show or hide it from the vertical bar (Normal View) and Media Detail view?

KANOO-4420,Story,ARM Merchant - Products - Allow uploading product media,"As a merchant creating products, I should be able to upload product images and videos. This is to bring consumers different visions on products.

*Acceptance Criteria:* 

* While creating a product, there is a new section called “Additional Images and Video“

** JPEG, PNG, JPG, WEBP, BMP, GIF and TIFF are allowable file types
** When clicking on Add Image, I’m capable of selecting one image or many images to upload.

*** The maximum of uploaded images is 20. If I try uploading over 20 images, it displays an alert {color:#00b8d9}_“You have reached the number of allowable uploaded images 20.“_{color}. After this message, no any images are uploaded
*** If I try uploading some files that are not Images type, it displays an alert {color:#00b8d9}_“Images only allows file types of JPEG, PNG, JPG, WEBP, BMP, GIF and TIFF. Please try again\!”_{color}. After this message, no any images are uploaded

** When clicking on Add Video, it expands a Video Type drop-down. There are 2 options, Upload Video and YouTube URL 
*** Upload Video: Selecting this displays a modal including 5 slots to upload videos

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* If I buy a gift card of a store that has cashback campaign, in CONFIRM & PAY screen, I see a new line item called Cashback positioned below TOTAL
* Apply this when buying gift card for myself and give it to friends
* Cashback here is always calculated based on the amount of TOTAL and the cashback promotion that merchant has set
** Display + <the number of cashback points> Points
** <the number of cashback points> always has commas
** For instance, merchant A has cashback promotion like this, Milestone 1: PAL(Pay at least) $2.00 Get 2 points, Milestone 2: PAL $5.00 Get 6 points. User A buys gift card of merchant A, his TOTAL amount is $4.00 so that he reaches Milestone 1. Therefore, he gets 2 cashback points . It displays Cashback +2 Points

# Group named “Kanoo Payments” contains functions relate to money and support for Kanoo users: Pay, Load, Withdraw, Top Up, Punch Card, Generate QR, AirPay QR Code
# Group named “Orders” contains functions relate to orders: create orders ( only for tablet), rename function “Orders” to “Orders List”, Scan Order
# Group named “The Sand Dollar” contains functions support external user make payment through physical SD card or reference SD app: Pay, Load, Withdraw, Receive Sand Dollar, Confirm Payment 
# Function “Transactions” displays all money transactions related to terminals in the same location
# Function “EOD Summary”
# Group named “Terminal Settings” contains functions for POS configurations: Adjust Cash, Update Terminal, Change PIN

KANOO-4047,Story,Gift Card Distribution - Multiple Merchant Money Flow,"Currently, when a user receives a GC that can be redeemed at multiple merchants from DOSS, he can redeem it at the issued merchant or another redeemable merchant. If he redeems at the issued merchant, the redemption flow doesn't change. If he redeems at another redeemable merchant, that merchant has to pay the Redemption fee and Redeemed amount. This doesn't make sense so that we need to define the flow.

The solution is after a user redeeming a GC at a redeemable merchant ( except the issued merchant) successfully. Kanoo Reserve Account will fund the redeemed amount for the redeemable merchant immediately.  The redeemable merchant only pays the Redemption fee. Kanoo Reserve Account will withdraw the redeemed amount from the issued merchant later ( not do in this period). Below is the money flow when a user redeems a GC given from DOSS at multiple linked merchants.

*Step 1:* a DOSS manager creates, marks issuer merchant then sends Gc to users successfully. The issuer merchant pays nothing for Kanoo

*Step 2:* The user redeems the GC at a redeemable merchant ( except the issuer) successfully. Ex: the user redeems $10 GC for $20 order

#  The Kanoo Reserve Account ( Cash Card or SD based on the user’s payment method) funds $10 of redeemed GC for the redeemed merchant. Save transaction with type “Fund Gift Card Redemption” for the redeemed amount on ARM ( for redeemed merchant and master) and Visipay (Transaction, Reserve Account, Card details)
# The redeemable merchant pays the Redemption fee for Kanoo based on the redeemed amount.

KANOO-4038,Story,[BE] - Buy Product Workflow - Redeem Points,"As a Kanoo user buying products, I should be able to use points for payments. 

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* At Confirm Purchase screen:
** Apply the priority on subtracting the amount the user has to pay: coupon => gift card => points.
** If the amount subtracted when the user selects the coupon / gift card is $0.00, the point selection will be disabled, user cannot select point. (disable “Select“ text)
** If point balance is 0, the point selection will be disabled, user cannot select point. (disable “Select“ text)
** If user chooses points first, then chooses coupon / gift card, the subtracted amount will be recalculated based on the priority of rule #1 above. If the final total amount is $0.00 (after choosing gift card / coupon card), rule #2 is applied.
** Example:
*** The total amount that the user has to pay is $ 20.00, they first choose $15.00 of points, then choose $6.00 of coupon. The value of the coupon will be subtracted as the highest priority (20.00 - 6.00 = $14.00), so the points the user previously selected is reset up to maximum $14.00.
*** The total amount the user has to pay is $20.00, they first choose $15.00 of points, then choose $20.00 of coupon. The value of the coupon will be subtracted as the highest priority (20.00 - 20.00 = $ 0.00), so the points previously selected by the user are reset to $0.00, which also means that point selection will be automatically disabled at that time.
** Disable the point selection if user point balance is 0 or the final amount that user need to pay is 0


+_Point Redemption_+

* In Order Summary box, there is a new line item called Point Redemption positioned below Gift Card, including Select link.
* There are 2 cases that we should disable the point selection
** User’s point balance is 0
** If the amount subtracted when the user selects the coupon / gift card is $0.00,
* Clicking on Select link display a modal with the following things:
** Point Available: this is user's point balance
** Point To Use: this is the text-field to enter the number of points
*** Allow entering only positive integers (including 0). It automatically adds commas when the number is greater than 999. For instance, 1,000 or 1,000,000
*** Default value is 0. 
*** Maximum points allowed: this is the maximum number of points that I can select. This based on the total amount that I have to pay
**** For example, I assume $1.00 = 100 points, if PB (Point balance) is 1,000 points, YP (You Pay) is $5.00 so that MPA (Maximum points allowed) is 500 points
**** Next example, if PB is 1,000 points, YP is $20.00 so that MPA is 1,000 points
**** Last, if PB is 1,000 points, YP is $10.00 so that MPA is 1,000 points
*** Point to Dollar: while I'm entering Point To Use amount, this always converts that point amount into dollar amount
**** The point exchange rate: this always $1.00 = 100 Points
*** When Point To Use is empty or 0, clicking on Apply button will display as when I do not use points
*** When I’m gonna enter a number that is greater than MPA, it automatically changes that number to MPA 
* When clicking on Apply button, it applies my selection. It displays the number of selected points below Point Redemption text, and Point Available.
* I can use Point Redemption function when using Cash Card, Sand Dollar Card, Kanoo Gift Cash Card 
* In case of guest payments, hide Point Redemption function


+_After payment_+

After making payment successfully with points use:

* User's point balance is updated by reducing the points used for the order.
* If merchant does not have enough points to give users, don’t reward points for user
* Points tab of Wallet - Point Redemption section: there is a new transaction. For example, Buy Product   -1,000
* Transaction: 
** A transaction is written in Visipay, ARM, User site
** Transaction Type: Point Redemption. It displays the dollar amount being equivalent to the number of used points. 
*** For instance, If I make a payment with 200 points used ($2.00), then YOU PAY remains $3.00 (I used Kanoo Kash Card to pay this remainder). If making payment successfully, I see 2 transactions
**** One is Kanoo Card Purchase with amount $3.00
**** One is Point Redemption with amount $2.00
*** If I make a payment that I COMPLETELY use points to payment. It records only one transaction. For instance, YOU PAY is $3.00 initially, I use 300 points (My point balance is 500) to make payment so that it records one transaction, Point Redemption with amount $3.00
** Some example
*** When buying product in Marketplace, if I use both points and money, for example, YOU PAY is $10.00, I used 500 Points and $5.00 Cash Card. It logs 2 transactions
**** Point Redemption
***** Amount B$5.00
***** Beneficiary: business name of merchant
***** Remitter: user full name
**** Kanoo Card Purchase
*** When buying product in Marketplace, if I use both points completely, for example, YOU PAY is $10.00, I used 1,000 Points. It logs 1 transaction
**** Point Redemption
***** Amount B$10.00
***** Beneficiary: business name of merchant
***** Remitter: user full name
*** When buying product in Reward Option, if I buy a gift card or product whose price is 500 Points. It logs 1 transaction
**** Point Redemption
***** Amount B$5.00
***** Beneficiary: business name of merchant
***** Remitter: user full name
* We also need to handle API for “Scan to Pay“ screens. There are 2 ways to go to this screen (this feature is only available in Mobile)
** Go to a store, click on Pay, input amount
** Go to detail of Kanoo Cash card/Sand Dollar card/Kanoo Gift Cash card, select Scan to Pay then scan a code

** <ValidateOTP>: this validates if OTP submitted is correct, Island Luck accounts is linked to Kanoo Account
** <MakePayment>: this is to make payment without login
** <RemoveToken>: this is to remove the token of Kanoo account linked
* In Island Luck site, on the first time, I do something to open login form in which I have to log in by Kanoo User. After logging in Kanoo successfully, it calls <GenerateToken>. Now, it returns OTP (it sends an OTP to phone number of Kanoo user). Next, it uses <ValidateOTP> to verify OTP
** If there are many OTP sent, the latest one is able to be used
** One OTP is expired after 1 minute
** It throws errors if entering expired or incorrect OTP
* After verifying OTP successfully, it returns a token for Island Luck to use for recurring payment(Island Luck account is officially linked to Kanoo Account).
* One Kanoo Account can be linked to many Island Luck accounts. Each Island Luck account needs to be verified OTP for the first time 
* On the next time using PWK via Island luck, I don’t see login form anymore. It navigates directly to the PIN-entering screen. Clicking on Make Payment button completes the payment as normal (call <MakePayment>)

So, the system must check if the merchant has the key or not then guide them to process the next steps. From now on, the merchant has to add items to the request to remind the consumer what he has bought. 

*Step 1:* Remove field “Amount”

*Step 2:* I click the button “Create New Payment Request”, I expect to see the message “Please click on Get Key button on Business KashKard tab to generate authentication key in order to create payment request.” if I don’t generate authentication key to use PWK component.

*Step 3:*  I can input items above the field “Description” with the following columns. I can see the list with 1 row by default. There are 2 parts of the information 

# Line item list: I input items, quantity, and the unit price of the invoice
## Name: format following “Product name” when creating a product. Default is “-”
## Unit Price: following  [https://kardsys.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KAR/pages/540410550/Kanoo+Standard+Format+Validation|https://kardsys.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KAR/pages/540410550/Kanoo+Standard+Format+Validation|smart-link]. Default is “$0.00”
## Quantity: only accept positive integer, no limit length. Default is “0”
# Line item total amount:
## Tax ( if have). Default is “$0.00”. Tax is calculated using Tax percent defined in Account screen if Tax is selected to apply. 
## Total Amount: auto-calculated based on “Tax” + sum of “Unit Price” * “Quantity”. Default is “$0.00”. 

*Step 4:* I can add more rows, edit or delete rows in the list. I can scroll the list if it has more than 3 rows

# If I want to add one more row, I have to input the previous row then the button “+ Add more item” enables to process. 
# If I want to edit a row, I click on the icon “Edit”, input all the field to enable the icon “Save” to save the new value, or click the icon “Cancel” to display the previous values
# If I want to delete a row, click the icon “Delete” on that row

*Step 5:* I complete the request like the current process

# *May 18, 2021:* I would like the system to check if the line items are empty, I would receive red text below the “Line Item” “Line items list cannot be empty.”

KANOO-3976,Story,ARM Merchant - Campaigns - Cashback,"As an ARM merchant, I should have the ability to create cashback promotions. Cashback rewards in particular have been a common favorite among traditional loyalty programs. This allows merchant to satisfy customers without devaluing or discounting merchants' products.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* When accessing Campaigns page then Campaign Manager, there is a new sub-tab called Cashback positioned next to Promotions
* Cashback is applied for payment types as below
** Buy Products (by Kanoo Cash Card, Kanoo Cash Card (gift), Sand Dollar Card)
** Buy Gift Cards (by Kanoo Cash Card, Sand Dollar Card)
** Pay with QR at store (by Kanoo Cash Card, Kanoo Cash Card (gift), Sand Dollar Card)

** Make payment for an unpaid order at store (by Kanoo Cash Card, Kanoo Cash Card (gift), Sand Dollar Card)
** Pay with Kanoo (by Kanoo Cash Card, Kanoo Cash Card (gift), Sand Dollar Card)
* There are 2 sections in this page, Discount and Point Reward

+_Discount_+

* This is the section to set the whole discount of that merchant
* This works as “Kanoo Network Commission percent“ in Account page
* Remove “Kanoo Network Commission percent“ in Account page
* The default value is 0.00
* I can enter a specific decimal number or use the input stepper to decrease or increase that number. 
** If using the input stepper, the step is 0.01
** I have the ability to enter only numbers, and one dot from keyboard. Allow entering only 2 numbers in decimal part
* The allowed discount range is from 0.00 to 90.00
* There is Save button to save the discount. Note this button is used for only saving Instant Discount. 
** If the discount is saved successfully, display message “Discount has been saved successfully.”
** If the discount is out of discount range, display message “Discount must be between 0.00 and 90.00”.

+_Point Reward_+

* This section is to reward consumers a specific number of points every time they reach an payment milestone while performing payment types as above
* There is two columns in this section: Pay at least and Cashback Amount
* *Pay at least* is the amount that user has to pay to get the number of points matching that amount milestone
** I can enter a specific decimal number or use the input stepper. If using the input stepper, the step is 0.01
** I have the ability to enter only numbers, and one dot from keyboard. Allow entering only 2 numbers in decimal part
* *Cashback Amount* is the number of points that user can get after paying the amount set in Pay at least column. 
** The number of point always has a comma if it is greater than 999. For instance, 1,000 points or 1,000,000 points
** This is always an integer number and greater than 0. The maximum number I can enter is 999,999
** I can enter a specific *integer* number or use the input stepper. If using the input stepper, the step is 1
** I have the ability to enter only numbers from keyboard
* One “Pay at least“ matches one “Cashback Amount“
* There is a button positioned at the bottom, called it New Row. Clicking on this adds a new row including 2 fields, one for Pay at least, another for Casback amount
** There are 2 buttons on each row, Save and Cancel. Clicking on Cancel removes that row
** Clicking on Save button validates things above
*** If I enter 0 or nothing in Cashback Amount, clicking on Save buttons displays message “Cashback Amount must be larger than 0“. Also, Cashback Amount field is highlighted in red
*** “Pay at least“ amounts betweens rows are always different. I’m not be able to create rows with the same amount. For example, I have created the first row with Amount $10.00 and Points 15, If I try to create a second one with Amount $10.00 and Point 16, it’s a failed attempt and I receive a message when clicking on Save button “This Pay At Least amount has existed.“ Also, Pay at least field is highlighted in red
*** If there is no problem, it creates that row successfully with message “Cashback Rule has been saved successfully.“ 
* After creating rows successfully, I can edit them. Each created row has two buttons, Edit and Delete
** Edit: clicking on this enables Pay at least and Cashback amount fields to edit. There are two buttons Save and Cancel as when creating row. Cancel is to cancel that editing. 
*** If I try to edit Pay at least amount into the one that has been created, clicking on Save button displays message “This Pay At Least amount has existed“ Also, Pay at least field is highlighted in red
*** If I enter 0 or nothing in Cashback Amount, clicking on Save buttons displays message “Cashback Amount must be larger than 0“. Also, Cashback Amount field is highlighted in red
*** If there is no problem, clicking on Save edits that row successfully with message “Cashback Rule has been saved successfully.“ 
** Delete: clicking on this should ask me “Are you sure to delete this cashback rule?“ with two buttons, Yes and No. 
*** Clicking on No does nothing. 
*** Clicking on Yes display message “Cashback Rule was deleted successfully.“ then removes that row from the list and it does not have effects anywhere.
* While editing a row, I can NOT add a new row or edit other rows. Let’s disable buttons and fields
* The list of rows is sorted based Pay At Least amount from the smallest to biggest amounts (from top to bottom)

# I can filter all fail statuses except “Completed” and “Failed - Charging User Credit Card” because the 2 statuses can not be resumed. -The progress bar at each transaction would help me know which steps it has passed. Order of these steps is: Charge User, Kanoo Reserve Credit Card, Kanoo Reserve Cash Card, Merchant Cash Card-  
# I can view the reason for each failed transaction.

*Step 3:* In the list, I can select one, multiple, or all transactions within the page to enable the button “Resume Failed Transactions” then click the button “Resume Failed Transactions”, the system will re-check then update statuses for selected ones. A confirmation pop-up with the content “Are you sure that you would like to resume <number> failed transaction(s)?” appears to ensure that I would like to resume those transactions

# If I click “Yes”, show icon loading tells me that the system is processing and I can not do anything until the process is complete
# If I click “Cancel”, close the pop up and I still can see the selected transactions 

*Step 4:* After the process is complete, I will receive the result 

# If I only select a transaction, show “The selected transaction is resumed successfully.” or “The selected transaction is resumed unsuccessfully. Please try again.”
# If I select multiple transactions, show “<number success> transaction are resumed successfully and <number fail> fail. Please try again.”

There’re several reasons causing the merchant name is not synced/saved/used correctly. So when storing the transactions could have different names even it’s the same Merchant. This leads to the issue of the Merchant Balance Report because it’s grouped by Merchant Name.

We expect to have fixed below:

# Guarantee that Merchant Name is synced correctly in all places when creating/editing.
# Guarantee that Merchant Name is saved and display correctly with the following characters: a-z 0-9 . # & / ? \! -  : () ,
# Guarantee that in the transactions using the same Merchant Name source(table column).
# Add Id into the Balance Report so that Admin can recognize if the same Merchant has changed their name.

KANOO-3893,Story,[BE] KanooPOS - Close out a shift as Manager,"While being a staff using KanooPOS, sometimes I forget to close cash drawer (shift closeout) on that POS so that in that case Manager should be able to help me to do that. This is to ensure my shift is technically closed out so the next staff member can take over.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* In PIN-entering screen of the staff that is going to close out his/her shift, there is an option called “Close Out as Manager“
* Selecting “Close Out as Manager“ opens the screen for the manager to enter User ID first then the next screen for entering PIN. 
** When entering User ID, 
*** I can enter user ID of staff or manager
*** If Manager’s location does not match terminal location, display the message “Login failed. Please make sure you have been assigned to the same location as this terminal“
*** Clicking on Back button moves to the previous screen
** When entering PIN
*** If I enter PIN of a staff, it displays message “This user does not have the permission to close out”. When clicking on OK button, it navigates back to User ID input screen and the value is clear
*** If I enter PIN of manager
**** If Manager enters incorrect PIN, it displays message “You have entered an invalid PIN. Please try again.“
*** Clicking on Back button moves to the previous screen
* After Manager enters PIN correctly, it moves to “Close Out Completed“ screen as normal. Clicking on Close button navigates to login screen of KanooPOS
* This applies for both manager and staff roles
** A shift of a Staff can be closed out by Managers
** A shift of a Manager can be closed out by other Managers

The “secret” or “secretKey” variable must be compare with the configureable one to demonstrate that it has the right to access then.;So here is the *solution* we apply:

secretKey: get from config

secret: get from parameter (API)

*SOLUTOIN 2*: VALIDATE secret key

line 252: return \!secret.equals(secret);

change to: return \!*secretKey*.equals(secret);

KANOO-3846,Story,[BE] PWK for Island Luck - Recurring payments without login,"As a user experiencing PWK associated with Island Luck, I should be able do recurring payments without login. This is to take less time for each payment, by simply entering only PIN to complete the process.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

* This feature is optional for Island Luck site.
* We *provide* Island Luck site the following APIs
** <Login>: this is to log in by Kanoo user
** <GenerateToken>: this returns OTP. This is always 4 digits
** <ValidateOTP>: this validates if OTP submitted is correct, Island Luck accounts is linked to Kanoo Account
** <MakePayment>: this is to make payment without login
** <RemoveToken>: this is to remove the token of Kanoo account linked
* In Island Luck site, on the first time, I do something to open login form in which I have to log in by Kanoo User. After logging in Kanoo successfully, it calls <GenerateToken>. Now, it returns OTP (it sends an OTP to phone number of Kanoo user). Next, it uses <ValidateOTP> to verify OTP
** If there are many OTP sent, the latest one is able to be used
** One OTP is expired after 1 minute
** It throws errors if entering expired or incorrect OTP
* After verifying OTP successfully, it returns a token for Island Luck to use for recurring payment(Island Luck account is officially linked to Kanoo Account).
* One Kanoo Account can be linked to many Island Luck accounts. Each Island Luck account needs to be verified OTP for the first time 
* On the next time using PWK via Island luck, I don’t see login form anymore. It navigates directly to the PIN-entering screen. Clicking on Make Payment button completes the payment as normal (call <MakePayment>)
* <RemoveToken>: use this API to remove any tokens
** When staying at PIN-entering screen, if my token is removed, clicking on Make Payment button displays message “The account token has not existed“",5,Done,,,,Kanoo Sprint 28 - Team 2,,,,,,Highest,Nguyen Tu Nghia,,,,,,image-20210423-121936.png;image-20210423-121944.png;image-20210423-121955.png;image-20210423-122006.png;PWK for Island Luck - Recurring Payments without Login.xlsx,,,,,,,"[~accountid:557058:13dd41e5-7d7a-45c5-8059-243206cbb843] [~accountid:5eeb358e96b9660abf6c15b5] we need to release this as a hotfix for Islandluck as they are waiting for this to go live their site.;Noted that;BE:

KANOO-3826,Story,"[KZ, WebApp] - Buy Product - Redeem Coupon By Entering Code","Currently, Kanoo users can only get coupons by access to store details then add them to their wallets. Before checkout, users will see a list of coupons that meet the below conditions:

* Provided from the store and valid at that time
* Already in their wallet 
* Shopping cart meet coupons’ requirements

Then users can select one of them to redeem. Since the Merchant Admin can create coupons with coupon code and decide users can get them in-store details or the merchant can send the code to users later, so we need to provide one more method to redeem them if users have the codes. It is entering code. Users can use this method in KZ, web app, and Kanoo app.

*Step 1:* I process to buy products flow, at the screen “Confirm & Pay“, I click “Select coupon” to open a list coupon, 

# I see at the top of the coupon list, a text field with the placeholder “Enter coupon code” and a button “Apply”. I expect the button to enable only when it has value. After entering the code, I click the button to validate its redeeming conditions.
# Below is the list of coupons created and can be redeemed at the store, the list named “Coupons from the store”. For each coupon in the list, I can click on it to view details with a button “Use” and “icon-close” pop-up for mobile or “icon back” for the web, then click the button “Use” in its details or on the row to validate its redeeming conditions  

*Step 2:* Then I click “Apply” or “Use”, the system will check then process next steps:

# Invalid entered code ( expired, incorrect code, not created by the merchant), I would see a red text below the field  “Enter coupon code” ( for Apply case) or below the chosen coupon “This coupon code is invalid. Please try again with another one.”
# If the coupon is over redeeming limitation of the store ( for entered code and the chosen one), a red text below the field “Enter coupon code” ( for Apply case) or below the chosen coupon “This coupon code is over the maximum redemption times.”
# If the coupon is over redeeming limitation of the consumer ( for entered code and the chosen one), a red text below the field “Enter coupon code” ( for Apply case) or below the chosen coupon “This coupon code is invalid. You have redeemed over the maximum redemption times.”
# If redeem coupon successfully ( for both apply and choose) , close the list then display order summary follow ticket [https://kardsys.atlassian.net/browse/KANOO-3731|https://kardsys.atlassian.net/browse/KANOO-3731|smart-link] 
# The system will check the coupon again and Merchant SD holding limitation when users submit payment. No changes for the current process

*Step 3:* the system will save transactions as the current process:

# Web app ( Orders, Transaction)
# App ( Orders, Transaction)
# POS ( Orders)
# ARM ( Transaction, update balance)
# Visipay ( Reserve Account, Transaction, Cash card or SD, Card detail)

* As a guest, refreshing page always keeps added products. For instance, a guest has added 4 products then the shopping cart is refreshed. Guest still sees 4 products displayed in cart
* If I clear cookies, it clears added products.
* If a guest adds some products to cart then logs in, the number of products is the sum of ones added when being a guest and ones added when being a logged user. For instance, Kanoo user (account A) added 4 products to cart then logged out. He  goes to BHT site as a guest and adds 10 products to cart then logs in as account A. After logging in, I see totally 14 products displayed in cart

On PWK, guest can pay using credit card as the first option and the second option is SD card.

*Step 1:* I access PWK page, I stay at the credit card form then I select a new payment method named 

# If the merchant has SD card then I can see 3 methods then I can click the method named “The Sand Dollar Card” to process the next steps.
# If the merchant does not have an SD card then I only see Guest Checkout and Kanoo Account tab defined in [https://kardsys.atlassian.net/browse/KANOO-4220|https://kardsys.atlassian.net/browse/KANOO-4220|smart-link] .

*Step 2:* I would see an SD QR code of the merchant to copy or scan. This QR contains the below information and it never be expired. I also see a countdown start from 5 mins. If I don't scan the QR code within that time, the page auto directs to the payment failed page so I can select a payment method again. I can not use Kanoo app to scan this QR because it only for reference SD app

## Encoded amount
# When I click copy QR code, I would like to see a toast “Copied\!”
# If I use the feature AirPay on Kanoo App to scan or type the generated QR code, I will receive a message “This QR code is not applied for Kanoo users. Please try again with another QR code to process payment.” 
# If I use an SD reference app to scan and pay successfully, the above Invoice ID will be added to the new column named “Unique Invoice ID” in transactions on ARM and Visipay. Save transactions like the current flow of guest checkout with a credit card. The merchant pays the fee “Sand Dollar Card - Processing Fee” for Kanoo.

*Step 3:* After scanning the QR code, I expect that I receive the payment result immediately. Keep the current informed result style.

+_Rules for calculating the number of added products_+

* As a guest, refreshing page always keeps added products. For instance, a guest has added 4 products then the shopping cart is refreshed. Guest still sees 4 products displayed in cart
* If I clear cookies, it clears added products.
* If a guest adds some products to cart then logs in, the number of products is the sum of ones added when being a guest and ones added when being a logged user. For instance, user A has signed in and added 4 products to cart then logged out. He adds 6 products to cart as a guest then logs in as account A. After logging in, totally 10 products displayed in cart
* If a guest adds 2 products to cart on Greencom site, then continue adding 3 products on Kard site, and logs on to Greencom site. The number of products is not counted when logging on Greencom site, he/she will see 2 products displayed in cart",13,Resolved,Backend,,KP-5199,KARD_S2127,,,7/15/2021,7/21/2021,,Medium,Nguyen Vuong Vinh Nguyen,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Scope:

* If user is pending for verification, show message: “Your KYC submission is being reviewed and the result will be sent to you soon.” and we need to direct user to KYC status view instead of KYC submit form.

+_Shopping Cart rules based on guest and logged users_+

*  As a guest, refreshing page keeps product added until I clear cookies. For instance, a guest has added 4 products then the shopping cart is refreshed. Guest still sees 4 products displayed in cart
* If a guest adds some products to cart then logs in, shopping cart displays products that guest has added. For instance, BHT user (account A) added 4 products to cart then logged out. A guest goes to BHT site and adds 10 products to cart then logs in as account A. After logging in, I see 4 products displayed in cart
* If a BHT user adds some products to cart then logs out, I see nothing in cart

The remaining part that I have to try is $148,000.00 - $1,000.00 = $147,000.00 so that the text is “$147,000.00 remaining to reach $148,000.00 milestone“

* The customer pays for Uni-ride (Owner) $48.00, including a $3.00 Parking fee (Additional fee).  
** Based on the allocated Reservation fee, the system will take $6.25 for Fee, and $0.75 for VAT on the Booking fee from the amount paid by the customer. This amount will be shared among entities (Payees). The remaining amount = Total amount - Reservation fee = 48 - 6.25 - 0.75 = $41.00.

We can push notification to user by using push notification with Twilio Chat Service when:

* A new message (This is sent to all members within a Channel when a new Message is posted to the Channel)
* -Add to channel (This is sent to Users that have been added to a Channel)-
* -Invited to channel (This is sent to Users that have been invited to join a Channel)-
* -Removed from channel (This is sent to Users that have been removed from a Channel they were a Member of)-

Each of the Push Notification types has a default template for the payload (or notification body) but we can be overridden per Service instance via the Push Notification configuration. The configuration allows each notification type to be enabled or disabled.

*TO-DO*

*Backend:*

* Add credential SID to the Access Token Chat grant for iOS endpoints request tokens.

*Mobile:*

* Provisioning Apple Developer credentials for APN Pushes
* Integrating and Register Push Notification when upon client startup
* Handle new push notification type and open chat screen when tapped on notification

With such a message we can pull out a lot of data, where {{sid_id}} is what we really need, to know who the sender is.

Based on this Spike we can do these in AC:

*  *_For Direct Message_*_:_ {color:#00b8d9}*_“\[Friend’s Name] just sent a message“_* {color}_(Ex: John Smith sent a message)_
* *_For Group Message:_* {color:#00b8d9}*_“\[Friend’s Name] just sent a message“_*{color} _(Ex: John Smith sent a message)_
* *_Tap on the notification_*_, I should be directed to the conversation screen with that friend or the group and I can see the latest message that he/she sent to me._
* *_Get message notification only when I hide the app to background_* _or the app is not being launched._

The things we need to do to get the above things are like:

# Enable push Notification chat feature of Twilio on web.
# Upload your API Key to Twilio, to generate an {{pushCredentialSid}} and from FCM SECRET.
# Provide {{pushCredentialSid}} for BE to config.
# Setup and register FCM Token for Chat feature of Twilio, when the user login to the app successfully.
#  Handle and add type to receive notifications of Twilio in FCM Service.

So we will change the approach to build 4 app on only 1 source code base. To do that we need:

# Create a new branch to use that to build 4 apps.
# Make this branch to have ability to build 4 apps. For iOS, we can use Build Target, for Android we can use build variants to do that.
# Here are some differences between these apps: (I will have QC to list out these differences in detail to make sure that we cover all of them)
#* Theme: colors and icons.
#* Inviting commission flow.
# Work with DevOps to integrate the CI/CD process to build these apps  from the new branch.
# Merge new feature, bug fixing of S2053 to this branch to make sure that we have the latest code

If user changes wallet PIN in another device, then they uses fingerprint / face ID on their own device to make transactions, they will see a dialog message {color:#6554c0}*_“Your PIN has been changed. Please enter the new PIN to process this transaction.“_*{color}. After closing this dialog, user needs to enter their new PIN, and below the PIN field they can see a checkbox *“Use Fingerprint for next transactions“* / *“Use Face ID for next transactions“*, user can check on that to make transactions with fingerprint / face ID next time.

** When the status is Preparing, I can update to Ready only: the order status is updated to Ready
** When the status is Ready, 
*** Pickup orders: I can update to Completed by two ways:
**** Scan QR code: the customer will present the QR code of their order to me, after scanning succesfully, navigate me to Order Detail screen (Completed status) and show the toast message *_“Order Completed\!“_*.
**** Manually: in case the customer forgets to bring their device, I can require them to provide their personal info (phone number, ID card…) and allow them to pick up their order without scanning. I can take note (write and take a photo) to keep track or skip, after that, navigate me to Order Detail screen (Completed status) and show the toast message *_“Order Completed\!“_*. I can see the note below the Order Detail screen.
*** Delivery orders: KardPOS staff cannot update anymore. The shipper can see the Ready order at Ready tab of Order Delivery app and pick to deliver.
* For School Menu orders, it only has two statuses New and Completed. After having been just created, the status is New and the order is on Pickup tab. At Order Detail, I can complete each item of order by Complete button or I can complete all by Pickup button of Order List. After completing all items of order, the status is updated to Completed.
* When I update status an order on KanooPOS, that should be synced up to:
** Kanoo app / Kanoo web / KZ site.
** Kanoo Order Delivery app.
** KanooPOS app login on another device.

+_Note:_+

* Pickup button is only enabled when the status of Pickup order is Ready. Otherwise, it will be grey out.

Reuse code base to build 4 apps

{quote}I was use this solution in my old company {quote}

Create multiple targets in ios app for single project:

h2. What is target ? 

{quote}_“A target specifies a product to build and contains the instructions for building the product from a set of files in a project or workspace. A target defines a single product; it organizes the inputs into the build system — the source files and instructions for processing those source files — required to build that product. Projects can contain one or more targets, each of which produces one product.”_{quote}

h2. Targets versus branching

* Using branches is not a bad approach by all means. However, there are some serious drawbacks when using them.
* Firstly, you may need to go back to your first app to solve bugs the users may have found. Once you’ve fixed those bugs, you will want to merge those fixes in your new branch just to see that you’ll have a bunch of conflicts.
* By the time you’ve successfully made the merge, you’ll notice that you’ve spend more time here than doing actual work on the new app.
* Fortunately there is a better way that does not require branching. Most IDE’s have some sort of target support (in Android they are called Flavors).
* Targets work more like configuration files. You use the same code for all your targets, but each target is configured differently, whether it’s a new app icon or a slight change in logic.
* The setup can be tricky but it’s far more powerful than using branches. Let me show you.

On Marketplace screen, I want to have one more tab named Products.

*_Products_*

* On this tab, I want to see the list of all products which are active from all businesses in system.
* The list of products will be shown as grid view mode.
* Each product being shown here must belong to at least one konnect category of any konnect zones and the konnect zone must be active.
* I can filter product with category by the filter icon on Search field:
** On clicking the icon, show the list of product categories screen.
** I can select / deselect one or multiple categories to filter.
** I can search by category name. In case there’s not any categories of no results when searching, show the message *_“No Categories Found.“_*
** For each selected category, it will be highlighted.
** I can tap Clear button to clear all filters. On clicking, all selected categories will be unselected, I can select other categories and get back to Products tab.
** Filter icon should be bold and colored if I am using filter.
** Keep the filtering results screen when switching between tabs Nearby, Online and Products.
* By default, I will see the list of products from all categories (*All*).
* For each product, I want to see:
** Product image
** Product name:
*** Show maximumly in 2 lines, use ellipsis if the product name is too long.
** Product price:
*** Show including the original price and the discount price (if available)
*** Show maximumly in 2 lines, use ellipsis if the price is too long.
** Business name:
*** Show maximumly in 1 lines, use ellipsis if the business name is too long.
* On tapping a product, I can see the product detail screen.
* I can search product by product name and business name:
** I can search with any words, characters or phrases contained in the name and search with no case-sensitive.
** Show all results if searching by blank characters or clearing keyword.
** Keep the searching results screen when switching between Nearby, Online and Products.
* I can sort product list by:
** Latest: sorting product list by latest created date
** Price:
*** Low to High.
*** High to Low.
** Most discounted (based on discount percentage): sorting product list by most discount.
* By default, the list of products will be sorted by discount price (low to high), if multiple products has the same price, they will be sorted by alphabet (A-Z).
* For three sort buttons (Latest, Price and Most Discounted), there must always one button checked. If user tap another button, the checked button is auto-unchecked.
* If no products is available or no matched searching / filtering results, display {color:#00b8d9}*_“No products found.“_*{color}.
* User can scroll down to hide Search field and Sorting price lines, but when they scroll up those lines should appear right away. (make it like Shopee app as the video attachment below).

When importing, the list of categories on pop-up is filtered by which categories have not existed yet from the list of tenant. (For ex: At first, tenant admin imported 10 categories from system from 1 to 10, if system admin adds a new category, the list on pop-up only displays categories which are added by system admin.

On the table of product categories:

* Name and Tags should be displayed maximum only one line.
* If Name and Tags are too long, there should have ellipsis, if admin hovers the mouse cursor on it, he can see the full Name and Tags.

*_Consumer Invitation Bonus_*

I want to have three fields:

* Bonus for Inviter field: 
** I can enter bonus amount for inviter.
** Bonus is not applied if the amount is $0.00
* Bonus for Invitee field: 
** I can enter bonus amount for invitee.
** Bonus is not applied if the amount is $0.00
* Condition (Minimum Purchase Amount of Invitee field): 
** I can enter minimum purchase amount of invitee so both inviter and invitee can get bonus. 
*** Note: this is applied for all payment flow by Kash Kard we have currently in system including buying product / gift card, pay with QR, scan to pay (AirPay & unpaid order), Pay With HYT.
** {color:#ff5630}*This is only applied for paying by kash kard.*{color}
** This condition amount is only applied for only one order and at any time. 
*** Example: the condition is $10.00, after registering, invitee can make order many times, the system will check which time the pay amount matches to the condition amount and offer points to either inviter or invitee.
** If the amount is $0.00, which means after the invitee signs up an account successfully, the bonus will be offered right away for inviter and invitee.

*_ARM Merchant Invitation Bonus_*

I want to have three fields:

* Bonus for Inviter field: I can enter bonus amount for inviter.
** I can enter bonus amount for inviter.
** Bonus is not applied if the amount is $0.00
* Bonus for Invitee field: I can enter bonus amount for invitee.
** I can enter bonus amount for inviter.
** Bonus is not applied if the amount is $0.00
* Condition (Purchase Subscription Plan checkbox): 
** I can check/uncheck so both inviter and invitee can get bonus.
** This condition will be checked by default. If this is unchecked, inviter and invitee can get bonus if invitee do not purchase ARM Subscription plan.

+_Note:_+

* Bonus will be offered to users as points. The points are taken from the default merchant of tenant.
* If the invitee bonus is configured, the inviter bonus is also required, which means that the admin can configure bonus for inviter only but both must be provided if the invitee has bonus. In case when the invitee has bonus and the inviter bonus is empty or $0.00, show the message {color:#00b8d9}*_“Bonus for Inviter is required.“_*{color}
* If the bonus amount is $0.00 or the condition is unchecked, we do not show Condition on Invite screen of mobile or web app.
* For the Condition (Minimum Purchase Amount of Invitee field): invitee has to make payment minimum the amount once time only, for example: the condition amount is $100.00, invitee has to pay minimum $100.00 so either invitee or invitee can receive the bonus.
* Record on My Rewards screen (Point tab of Wallet):

KP-2136,Story,KanooPOS Tablet - Create Order,"As the merchant staff, I want to be able to create an order for customer at store.

+*AC:*+

I tap Create Order button on the menu list to open Create Order screen. The button should be located at the first home screen after I login to KanooPOS.

On Create Order screen:

* At top, I can see three fields First Name, Last Name and Phone Number and an edit icon, on clicking the Customer Information Dialog is opened, it includes fields below:
** Phone Number (*required*): On this field I can select the country code (country flag and number code) before entering the phone number behind, the app will check the phone number and it will suggest the list of users matching to that phone number. In this case, First Name and Last Name fields will be auto-filled afterwards.
** First Name: auto-filled from the phone number.
** Last Name: auto-filled from the phone number.
* I can see the list of product categories of my merchant. 
** This list displays all product categories created by merchant admin:
*** When I select a specified category, show the list of products associated with that category.
*** When I select All, show all products by the display condition below.
** This list is sort by category name (alphabet).
** I can slide to see more.
* Below the list of product categories, I can see the list of products belonging to the current category. 
** {color:#6554c0}+*Display Condition*+{color}{color:#6554c0}+:+{color} Each product being displayed on the screen must be contained by at least one konnect category (Product type), and this konnect category must belong to at least one konnect zone which is being active.
** A product can be still displayed even if it’s not associated with any product categories:
** For each product, I can see product image, product name, price (original and discount price) and Add button. I can tap that to add product to the cart:
*** For a product which have no options: it will be added to Cart right away.
*** For a product which have options inside: Product Detail pop-up will be opened. I can select options and tap Add to List button to add it to Cart.
** The list of product will be sorted by the latest created date from top downwards.
* Below the list of products, I can see Scan Products button: I can tap that to open Scanning Product screen. When Scanning Product screen is opened, I can see Browse Products button, I can tap that to switch again the list of products screen again. In case scanning invalid barcode, show the message “Invalid barcode. Please try again.“
* I can search products by product name or barcode.
* At right side, I can see the cart zone containing products added:
** For each product of Cart, I can see: 
*** Product image, product name, product price (discounted), product options.
*** Quantity field: I can edit the number of products I want to buy by tapping + / - button or modifying the number.
*** (x) icon: I can tap to remove the product out of Cart.
** Above the Cart, I can see Clear button. On tapping, I can remove all products out of Cart. The confimation pop-up will be displayed *_“Are you sure to remove all items?“_* and two buttons:
*** OK: Close the pop-up and remove all items from cart.
*** Cancel: Close the pop-up and nothing’s changed.
** Below the Cart, I can see Sub Total, Tax and Total amounts and Create Order button. 
** On tapping Create Order button, Payment Method pop-up is opened:
*** Pay with QR: After selecting, the payment screen is opened (same as when tapping Pay button from the menu list):
**** The paid amount is auto-filled by the order amount. Payment Cards will be the same, too.
**** Discount field will be not displayed.
**** The function works on this screen will be as same as the old flow. (scan Cash Card / Gift Cash Card / Sand Dollar with gift card)
*** Pay Later: Save as an unpaid order.

KP-1746,Story,Consumer App - Change the rule of rounding number for money in the system,"+*AC:*+

* The new rule of rounding a number:
** If the third decimal number (after comma) is less than 5: keep the second decimal number.
*** Example: 3.474 ~ 3.47; 3.621 ~ 3.62
** If the third decimal number (after comma) is equal to or larger than 5: increase the second decimal number a unit.
*** Example: 3.475 ~ 3.48; 3.678 ~ 3.68
* We will update the way of rounding number for buying product flow:
** Firstly, the *Product Price (discounted)* will be rounded.
** The *Tax* amount will be rounded based on the product price (rounded above)
** *Coupon/Gift Card/Cause2Fund/Point/* amount will be rounded based on the product price (including Tax and rounded above).
** *Total amount (You Pay)* will be the sum of all amounts rounded (Product Price, Tax , Coupon/Gift Card/Point/Cause2Fund).

Ex: A product costs $25.99, after discount the price is $24.9504 ~ *$24.95*

The tax is 12%, so the tax amount will be 24.95*0.12=2.994 ~ *$2.99*

Coupon is 8%, so the coupon amount will be (24.95+2.99)*0.08=2.2352 ~ *$2.24*

Cause2Fund is 6%, so the Cause2Fund amount will be (24.95+2.99)*0.06=1.6764 ~ *$1.68*

The Total amount will be 24.95+2.99-2.24-1.68 = *$24.02*

KP-1371,Story,[Android] - KardPOS - Update Order Status,"As a merchant staff, I want to be able to update status for each order, so that delivery staff (shipper) can know that which order is ready to deliver to customer.

+*AC:*+

* On Order Detail screen, I can update order status:
** When the status is New, I can update to Preparing only.
** When the status is Preparing, I can update to Ready only.
** When the status is Ready, 
*** Pickup orders: I can update to Completed by two ways:
**** Scan QR code: the customer will present the QR code of their order to me, after scanning succesfully, navigate me to Order Detail screen (Completed status) and show the toast message *_“Order Completed\!“_*.
**** Manually: in case the customer forgets to bring their device, I can require them to provide their personal info (phone number, ID card…) and allow them to pick up their order without scanning. I can take note (write and take a photo) to keep track or skip, after that, navigate me to Order Detail screen (Completed status) and show the toast message *_“Order Completed\!“_*. I can see the note below the Order Detail screen.
*** Delivery orders: KardPOS staff cannot update anymore. The shipper can see the Ready order at Ready tab of Order Delivery app and pick to deliver.
* When I update status an order on my device, that should be synced up to the other devices used by the other staffs.
* The UI of updating status should follow Action Sheet like Order Delivery app (the previous sprint).

+_Note:_+

* Pickup button is only enabled when the status of Pickup order is Ready. Otherwise, it will be grey out.
* The mamximum input at Note field is 500 characters including space.
* If an order is updated by two staffs at the same time, who goes after will get a message pop-up *_“This order has been processed by another staff.“_* and update the status to the latest status of that order.

** Date range: Default is empty (“*Select date range*”). Format MM/DD/YYYY. Start date must to the same or before the end date. This validation rule should be control by the date picker meaning user cannot select the invalid date range.
** Filter icon should be highlighted when being used.
* Lazy loading: Load 20 transactions at the first time and load more 20 items when user scroll to the end of the list.
* See the format for each transaction in the UI but refer to the excel file for the value of each transaction type.
* When no transactions recorded (with a new account), show the message at center {color:#00b8d9}_“No transactions found“_{color}_._ This message should be used even when filter has no results.

KP-990,Story,Backend - Save Shopping Cart,"As a customer I want to be able to save products to my shopping cart to order then.

+*Acceptance Criteria:*+

* Show the toast message “{color:#00b8d9}*_Product added to cart_*{color}“ every time adding product to cart successfully.
* Cart Icon (Home screen):
** Users should able to see the cart icon on the home screen.
*** The number badge on the cart icon is the total products on cart. The maximum number displayed here is 99+.
*** The number badge will be refreshed when the home screen is opened
*** If only number is refreshing, user should not see the loading circle, it is a bad UX, just call the API to refresh and update the UI when it done
** Tapping the cart icon will navigate the user to the “Cart“ screen.
* I can select and save products of different merchants into my Cart.
* I can select a product multiple times to add to my Cart.
* Cart is saved on server and I can see it after that on all devices.
* I can open Product Detail screen from the Cart screen (for product including or not including options).
* For each product on the cart, I want to see:
** Product name
** Product image
** Quantity field to edit
** Original price
** Discount price (for a single item)
** Delete icon: On clicking this icon, the app shows a confirmation pop-up (the pop-up template depends on mobile platform) saying _“Are you sure to remove this product from your cart?“_ with two option buttons OK and Cancel.
*** OK: Close the pop-up and remove the pop-up.
*** Cancel: Close the pop-up and nothing’s changed.
** Options for a product (if available)
* Cart should be update when:
** I added new product from store detail to my card
** I update the number of product that I want to buy on cart detail screen:
** I remove any product on cart detail screen
** Product of a merchant on my cart should be reset after I buy them

* User can edit the number of a product they want to buy:
** By (+) or (-) buttons. User can only decrease minimum to 1 and increase maximum to the current inventory number of a product.

* On the top-right corner of card image, I can see the More options (three dots icon). On tapping, I can see Delete option:
** iOS: use Action Sheet
** Android: same as design
* When I choose Delete, I want to see a confirmation pop-up saying _“Are you sure you want to delete this card?“_ with two buttons OK and Cancel.  The pop-up format depends on each mobile platform.
** OK: show the toast message saying _“Delete successfully\!“_, the card is only removed from user’s wallet (soft delete).
** Cancel: close the pop-up.

*** Show maximumly in 1 line, use an ellipsis if the price is too long.
* On tapping a product, I can see the product detail screen.
* I can search product by product name, product category name and tags:
** I can search with any words, characters or phrases contained in the name and search with no case-sensitive.
** Show all results if searching by blank characters or clearing keywords.
* I can sort the product list by:
** Latest: sort product list by the latest created date
** Price:
*** Low to High
*** High to Low.
* By default, the list of products will be sorted by discounted price (low to high), if multiple products have the same price, they will be sorted by alphabet (A-Z).
* If no products are available or no matched searching/filtering results, display {color:#00b8d9}*_“No products found.“_*{color}.

*_Gift Cards_*

On this tab, I want to display all my gift cards, same as when I tap Buy Gift Card button (refer to the Buy Gift Card button at Nearby tab of the current Store Detail screen).

The list of gift cards displayed are the gift cards belonging to the konnect category of gift card from the konnect categories of GC. This is the current rule.

KP-910,Story,[Backend] Visikard Admin - Manage Product Categories,"As a System Admin, I want to be able to manage the list of default product categories and also support a tenant to manage their category list.

+*AC:*+

On the left menu, I click an item named Product Categories to open Product Categories page.

The page will be seperated into 2 tabs: *System* and *Tenants*

On System tab, I can see:

* *New Category* button: On clicking New Product Category pop-up is opened, on this pop-up:

||*Fields*||*Description*||*Display*||*Required*||*Validation*||
|*Name*|I can enter category name.|Textbox|Yes
If Name field is missing, show red error message {color:#ff5630}*_“Name is required“_*{color}|Name is unique.
Max length: 50 characters.

Error message: {color:#ff5630}*_“This name already exits.“_*{color}|
|*Tags*|I can enter tags for the new category. After each tag, I can seperate by hitting Enter.|Textbox|No|No|

||*Buttons*||*Click to action*||
|Save Changes|Close the dialog and add new category to the table.|
|Cancel|Close the dialog and the action is cancelled.|



* Clone for Tenant button: On clicking, show Import Category pop-up:
** Tenant field: displaying the list of tenants (*Kard, GreenCom, HYT, …*) as a drop-down list to select.
** The list of categories are displayed, each item will have a checkbox, I can search, select one by one / multiple / all.
** Buttons:
*** Clone: close the pop-up, the list of selected categories will be cloned for the selected tenant. 
*** Cancel: close the pop-up, the action is cancelled.
* Below the *New Category* button, there’s a table of created categories including columns:
** Name: displaying category name
** Tags: displaying tags of the category
** Action:

||*Buttons*||*Click to action*||
|Edit ({color:#ff5630}*this option is not displayed on Tenant tabs*{color})|Edit Category pop-up is opened. On this pop-up, the UI and function are as same as when creating a new category, but the fields are populated from the current info.|
|Remove|Remove Category pop-up is opened:
* Message: *_“Are you sure to remove the category \[category name]?“_*
* Buttons:
** Remove: Close the pop-up and remove the category.
** No: Close the pop-up and the action is cancelled.|



* I can search category on the table by name and tags.

On Tenants tab, I can see

* The list of categories of all tenants have been cloned from system.
* The list of categories are displayed as a table including below columns:
** Name: displaying category name
** Tags: displaying tags of the category
** Tenant: displaying tenant name
** Action:
*** Remove
* I can filter the list by tenant.

+_Note:_+

On System tab:

* When system admin adds a new category,{color:#00b8d9} *it will not impact to the list of other tenants.*{color}
* When system admin edits or removes a category, {color:#00b8d9}*it will impact to the list of tenants, the list displayed on consumer web / app.*{color}

On Tenants tab: When system admin removes a category, {color:#00b8d9}*it will not impact to the list of other tenants or system (on System tab)*{color}. (For ex: System admin removes a category of GreenCom tenant on Tenants tab, there is only tenant admin of GreenCom cannot see it anymore).

On the table of product categories of each tab:

* Name and Tags should be displayed maximum only one line 
* If Name and Tags are too long, there should have ellipsis, if admin hovers the mouse cursor on it, he can see the full Name and Tags.

In case if there’s not any categories or no results of searching, show the message *_“No Categories Found.“_*

+*Acceptance Criteria:*+

* User can add products to the cart.
* On Cart page, user clicks Proceed to Checkout. 
* On Confirm Purchase page, user can see an option Coupon below Gift Cards.
* On clicking Coupons option, the pop-up shown up:
** Title: Select Coupon
** Show the list of coupons which user has added to wallet.
** User can select or unselect any coupons on the list.
* The total amount which user has to pay finally must be correctly calculated.
* After payment:
** The order is saved on Orders page. (user can also see coupon amount which was used).
** The transaction named Coupon Redemption should be recorded on Transactions page, ARM site (Merchant Admin / Master Admin), Visipay site, Visikard Admin site.

+Validation rule:+

* The list of coupons shown on the pop-up only belongs to the certain store which user has added before, which means user cannot see the coupon from the store A if they buy product from the store B.
* If the coupon amount makes the final total amount which user has to payment is $0, Point option is disabled. (Ex: User buys a product with the total amount $3.00, he uses a coupon $3.50, so the final total amount he has to pay is $0.00, he cannot select point at that time).
* The coupon buy X get X only shown if user buys products corresponding to its content. (Ex: The coupon is Buy 2A to get 1B, this only shown if user buys enough 2A. Otherwise, it’ll be not shown). 
* User can only use one coupon at the same time while doing payment. 
* User cannot see the coupons which was used in Wallet page (Coupon tab).

# After using the coupon “Buy X get Y” to payment, how to check “Product Y” in the app? For now, we do not record any transactions for this action.
## This coupon is applied for the order that customer uses and it is not applied for an later order. Please check with Na on this to understand how it works and also keep in mind that this is not scope of this story. If this coupon does not work for the current payment flow, please create a bug and assign to me to review.
# The sort order when clicking on Coupon. I assume that we will use the created date for sorting.
## I don’t think sorting by date is a good for showing the coupons that the current customer has because we need to show the coupons that can be applied for the current order only and that list should not be long as they are coupons that the current customer has for the current merchant only.
# The user can able to unselect the GK in the list when he wants to unchoose. I think we need to apply this behavior for Coupon as well.
## Agree. We need to a way for customer to unselect a coupon.

!image-20200916-103636.png|width=1869,height=804!

so I think we need to move it out of sprint 2036

Please confirm.;[~accountid:557058:27d8b1c9-b5a9-4bcc-a002-d9834fc57e78] How was that relevant to this ticket?

Keep it and test later.; [~accountid:5ed479f02bea5a0c2f1433fa] Okey, I mean when creating new merchant, user will not receive the KYC email anymore and Master Admin cannot resend the KYC email to merchant user because it has been remove on the “Merchant Account” tab as above screenshot. So there is no way to access the KYC form for merchant, so QC cannot verify this ticket in this sprint.

[~accountid:557058:7a9d9191-dd75-4672-98d1-725766bcd349] I’ve got it, so how’s about a status of this ticket?

So QC don’t need to verify this story in S2036.;I reserve 1 point for this ticket to check it after the other KYC tickets completed;I'm implementing the KYC form for both the individual and corporate using Angular in sprint S2103.

Ticket [https://kardsys.atlassian.net/browse/KP-2765|https://kardsys.atlassian.net/browse/KP-2765|smart-link] 

After checking the current localization, I will localize the language for the form during implementing the KYC form. So please add 1 more point to the estimation.

Total point for this ticket is 2pts

I have contacted the FE team to get the API Key “{color:#36b37e}AIzaSyDWgt2nN5rRT5VfDYVPIO1CY0wlIgpOL4c{color}“ and they noted that for the Geocode API we can just send 1000 request in day for free.

1. This button is enabled for merchants that are active and verified for KYC only.
--> There is a new change from KYC verified is that the merchant does not need to pass KYC. So do we need to apply this rule?

2. When I click on this button, I can select one of the subscription plans except FREE (ECONOMY plan) on the popup.
--> Currently, we have 4 subscription plans: Economy, Bronze, Silver, Gold. The ""Free Upgrade"" button will be only shown for 2 subscription plans: Bronze and Silver, correct?

3. I think we need to show the success message when upgrading the subscription plan successfully, correct? If yes, please define the message. 

4. I do not understand clearly about your answer to Thuy. I mean when I click on the Free Upgrade button:

* When my current subscription plan is Bronze, the popup will be shown: Silver & Gold
* When my current subscription plan is Silver, the popup will be shown: Gold
Is it correct?

5. The month in ""Complimentary Platinum Mode"" is always shown ""1M 2M 3M"" and not highlighted the selected trial month when I choose free for 1 month, 2 months or 3 months.

!screenshot-1.png|width=200,height=183!

 
--> My expectation is when choosing any freely trial month, the corresponding item should be highlighted. It should also apply when using the free update button. 

6. After exploring the system with 1 free monthly, do we need to disable the item ""1M 2M 3M""?;[~accountid:5b43ade2a492e959f3f3248b]

KP-423,Story,API - Consumer Apps - Buy Product Flow - Redeem Points,"As a customer, I would like to be able to redeem points when purchasing products while the current process allows me to pay with kash kard, gift cards and coupons.

* I select a product from anywhere in a consumer app.
* At the Purchase Confirmation screen:
*# Apply the priority on subtracting the amount the user has to pay: coupon => gift card => points.
*# If the amount subtracted when the user selects the coupon / gift card is $0.00, the point selection will be disabled, user cannot select point.
*# If user chooses points first, then chooses coupon / gift card, the subtracted amount will be recalculated based on the priority of rule #1 above. If the final total amount is $0.00 (after choosing gift card / coupon card), rule #2 is applied.
** Example:
*** The total amount that the user has to pay is $ 20.00, they first choose $15.00 of points, then choose $6.00 of coupon. The value of the coupon will be subtracted as the highest priority (20.00 - 6.00 = $14.00), so the points the user previously selected is reset up to maximum $14.00.
*** The total amount the user has to pay is $20.00, they first choose $15.00 of points, then choose $20.00 of coupon. The value of the coupon will be subtracted as the highest priority (20.00 - 20.00 = $ 0.00), so the points previously selected by the user are reset to $0.00, which also means that point selection will be automatically disabled at that time.
* At the checkout step of buying product, I can select number of points that I want to use to pay for the order of buying product.
** Maximum value of ""seekBar"" must be
*** If my balance is in USD, so total amount I pay: Exchange rate * total amount to be paid.
**** For example, my balance is 1200, the exchange rate is 100 points = $ 1, the total I pay is $ 3.12 => maximum I can choose = 100 * 3.12 = 312 point = 3.12 dollars.
*** If the balance of feature II with the USD small more or by total money, I must be paid: Maximum points, I can choose will be the points I use:
**** Example: my balance is 1200, the exchange rate is 100 points = $ 1, the total I pay is $ 15 => I can choose a maximum of $ 1200 = $ 12
** The increment step of “seekBar” should be $1 (100 pts)
** Whenever I select points, I can see the exchanged amount that I can pay for the current order based on the used points.
* If the transaction is failed because I don’t have enough points that I selected for any reason. Display the error message “You don’t have enough points“.
* Seperate the value of points with a comma  (like money). Ex: 1,500 points / 10,000 points
* After buying the order successfully:
** My point account is updated by reducing the points used for the order.
** I see one reward transaction in Reward Redemption section under Points tab of wallet.
** Update one more row in Order Detail: Point with
** I can take orders through delivery or pickup (at exactly the store which I have purchased).
** Disable the point selection if user point balance is 0 or the final amount that user need to pay is 0

By the way, on the current UI design, I think this is inconvenient for UX.

I think that’s enough to start developing.
By the way, on the current UI design, I think this is inconvenient for UX. When sliding to adjust the number of point to redeem, the number may be changed really quick, it will take lots of time for user to adjust exactly the number of point they want to redeem.

I don’t think show only Online Store is a good idea for people that refuse to Allow Location.

I concur with the team’s feedback regarding the Search bar. Actually, at HYT App, that search bar is placed below the Map.

Thank you.;[~accountid:5c6e1d28f2f4366be3ccaeff] I have some questions on this item:

# “Whenever I access Marketplace page, I expect to receive the request from the app to access my device’s location if my current location is not configured.“ Do you mean we will ask for the “Location access permission“ if we don’t have this?
# “I expect to be able to view Online tab if I don’t setup my location.“ I think the Online tab should be able to view regardless of whether users setup their location or not.
# Do we need hide the Nearby tab if we can’t get user’s location because of permission lacking?
# Where can we define the “konnect categories of gift cards“? Is that the Konnect Category on ARM portal? If yes, I don’t understand how can we use it to filter the gift cards
# We don’t have Brand for in-store gift cards, so what we will display on this field for them?;Hello [~accountid:557058:13dd41e5-7d7a-45c5-8059-243206cbb843] ,

Here are my responses:

# Yes, we need to ask for location accessibility permission since there are features associated with that permission.
# Your observation is correct. However, that is one of the expectations used in the “Set My Location”.
# No, we don’t.  We will inquire user for location permission whenever they want to access to “Nearby” tab.

# We should keep the behavior of request user location access permission as the current:
## We are asking for this permission right after user open the app home screen
## If user reject this request, we cannot open the permission request popup any more because that is a system popup. On this case, we are displace a text “No store found.“ on this screen and the map is empty, but user can still set their location manually by clicking on Set My Location button.
# We have the filter for Business Category already so do we need the feature that allow user search Business Category?
# I assume that the search action will be perform when user click on OK/search button on the keyboard
# *“I can scroll down to load more businesses based on their konnect zone’s locations to be showed from near to far.”* You can load more item by scrolling down the maximum distance from the location of any item on this list to the user location is *10 miles.* Just want to make sure that we are in the same page on that.
# On online tab, if we have gift cards that have the same discount, the same brand, then we should sort them by another field. I suggest “Created date” for that;[~accountid:557058:13dd41e5-7d7a-45c5-8059-243206cbb843] See my response for your questions.

# Agree
# I think searching with category is convenient for customers, so let add it if there is any issue about technical or it has much effort to do.
# Correct as this is the current behavior of the app. For the web, the search function should be triggered when user presses Enter. I think VisiKard wants to trigger the searching after customers enter some characters but this behavior can impact the performance even it is better. Please consider the second option.

+*AC:*+

On Home page, user can see a Connections button. When I click at that one, it shows Your Connections page.

* On Your Connections page:
** The page title: Your Connections
** The default connection group: All Kard (All GreenCom), Co-workers, Family, Friends, Favorites.
** If user has not connected any user / merchant, the default image of group is used as same as All Kard group (Kard loading).
** When user click at any connection group, it shows the page of that connection group, they can see all connections I had chosen and added to this group.
* On the page of connection group:
** The group name displayed at the top.
** The list of connections are shown below (avatar/merchant logo and customer name or business name).
** In a group, user detail pop-up (containing chat and send icons) is opened on clicking at user’s avatar. Store detail page is opened on clicking at merchant’s logo image.
** There are buttons “Edit group” and “Remove this group”.
*** When I click at Edit Group button:
**** Remove icon appears on each connection, if user click that icon, that connection will be removed.
**** Edit icon appears next to group name, if user click that icon, Edit Group Name pop-up is displayed, user can enter a new name and click Done button to save.
**** There are two buttons: Done and Add Member.
***** Add Member: user click that to open the list of connections pop-up, on this pop-up, user can see the connections which they had added but not existing in the group, each line of list will have a checkbox, which allows user to add multiple connections to the current group, below the list is OK button, on clicking that the pop-up will be closed, user can see the new connection(s) added at the bottom of the list.
***** Done: user click that to return View mode.
*** When I click at “Remove this group” text, a confirmation pop-up shown up and says “Are you sure you want to remove this group?“ and two buttons Remove, Cancel and a close button at the corner (x).

||*Button*||*Action*||
|Remove|Remove the group, redirect to Your Connections page.
User cannot see that group on Your Connection page any more.|
|Cancel|Close the confirmation pop-up, no action performed.|
|Close button (x)|Close the confirmation pop-up.|

*_Validation rules:_* 

* Edit group: 
** If the connections are removed from a group, they can be stored in the other groups (at least in the default group All Kard). 
** The name of default group (All Kard) is not allowed to edit, user can only edit the name of other groups. 
* Remove group: The default group (All Kard) is not allowed to remove, user can only remove the other groups except that one.

There’s a button “Add new group” so that user can actively add a new group to Your Connections page. When I click at Add New Group button, Add New Group pop-up. User can enter new group name then save by clicking Save button. A new group is added next to Add new group button (on the left side).

Even on mobile phones, there're cases the service provider turn off sms.

Solution: We build a function so that Merchant can get their OTP via Phone Call.

Scope: ARM Merchant Registration, ARM Merchant Change Phone Number

*AC1:*

1. Allow Merchant to use landline phone number

2. When Merchant provides a phone number. We have dropdown options for verify the phone number on the same screen, allow Merchant to choose: “Send OTP via SMS” or “Get OTP via Phone call”.

3. If Merchant chooses “Send OTP via SMS” but using a landline. We should warning:

3.1. When change phone number: “Unable to send OTP via SMS to your new phone number. Please make sure your new number is a valid mobile phone number and try again.“

3.2. Other cases: “Unable to send OTP via SMS to your phone number. Please make sure your number is a valid mobile phone number and try again.“

4. When Merchant chooses the Phone Call option, our system will make a phone call to Merchant automatically with a pre-defined message: ""This is Kanoo calling with your verification code. Your verification code is \[OTP code]. Again, your verification code is \[OTP code]. Thank you.

5. Merchant confirms OTP.



Phone calls will cost a lot of money. We will need to prevent Merchant from repeatedly use this feature.

*AC2:*

Configure a rule for admin say: Maximum Phone calls request per day e.g 10 times / day

When the Merchant has reached limitation, we don’t make anymore phone call but warning the Merchant: “You seem to have trouble getting and verifying your OTP.

* Transactions & Transactions Detail: replace solution get raw content with download file with streaming response technology to prevent out of memory issue. With this approach the response will be send each package to client then release the memory of server immediately until the progress is completed,
* Dashboard: Root cause is client call the API get data in visipay then visipay call reporting service to get data so just need update the client call direct to reporting to prevent delay via network and reduce the time when calling between those services. Beside that, I removed some unused data to improve the performance (fee chart is not available on current version).

* When creating a new event, 
** “Record URL” field should be disabled because before the video (or streaming) starts, there is no video links generated so that this field is only enabled when Admin edits the event. At that moment, JW player has generated a specific link for video.
* “Host field” is defined as a non-required field. I think every streaming should require a specific host?
* We have two email templates for notifying events creation and events changes
** Email subject of events creation: “*Get Ready For A New Event\!*“
** Email subject of events changes: “*What’s New At \[Event Previous Event Name]*“ in case I make some changes such as Start time, Event Name,.. etc

*Important Note*: 

* All Crypto addresses are stored at VisiPay’s database for effective maintenance.
* Crypto balance will have X digits in decimal (follow the config from Visipay)
* We can setup a minimum threshold for each reserve account. If the reserve account balance goes below that amount, the account should be automatically funded to a specified threshold (UI will be updated later)
* Each 20 min we will check the balance with the threshold then fund to reserved account if the balance is under the threshold
** See updated API document with the new endpoint {{'api/admin/fund_reserve'}} to fund reserve accounts.
** When you call the endpoint, the account is funded from the master account. ETH MASTER, ZVC MASTER or KARD MASTER
* Admin can add/edit/remove the reserved accounts
* We should also display the balances of ETH MASTER, ZVC MASTER or KARD MASTER in Visipay
* Allow user to config the amount of auto funding for each address

KSWAT-8,Story,ARM Campaign - Konnect Category for Video,"As I merchant I want to be able to create a konnect category to upload videos to show them to customer on store detail of consumer apps.

* Keep the current way of saving video files and we will enhance later to make this issue fixed quickly.
* Video library for the consumer apps to use will not changed in the scope of this update.",3,Done,,,KP-1,,,,,,,High,Khang Nguyen,,,,,,image-2020-06-29-18-20-28-403.png;image-20200715-163356.png;image-20200716-114020.png,,,,,,,"c [~accountid:557058:7a9d9191-dd75-4672-98d1-725766bcd349] the old way is we’re calling directly from the javascript to media service to convert the video without any authentication. I think that’s not the good way because if someone see this api they can upload anything that they want to our system. The root cause of error is we secured the request from ARM to core to make sure it’s internally. There are 2 options here:

* Keep the old way and take risk (as I mentioned above)
* Hide the video uploading for now and implement other way (javascript → ARM → media)

Please let me know your thought
